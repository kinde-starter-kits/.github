## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find starter kits for a bunch of different tech stacks to work with the Kinde ecosystem.

If you're a founder with a new idea and you want to get up and going quickly, this is a great place to get started.

All you need to do is:

1. Clone the repo for your tech stack of choice.
2. [Register a Kinde account](https://app.kinde.com/register) 
3. Put the credentials from your new Kinde account in a `.env` file in your new project (a sample is provided for you to copy)
