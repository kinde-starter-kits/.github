# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here youâ€™ll find starter kits for a bunch of different technology stacks to work with the Kinde ecosystem.

If youâ€™re a founder with a new idea and want to get up and going quickly, this is a great place to start. Conversely, if you already have a project underway, consider using one of the [Kinde SDKs](https://github.com/kinde-starter-kits).

All you need to do is:

1. Clone the repository for your technology stack of choice.
2. [Register a Kinde account](https://app.kinde.com/auth/cx/_:nav&m:register&lid:ac4bc3ac-3511-4600-9ab7-e3c55bf172af).
3. In your new project, put the credentials from your new Kinde account in the `.env` file (a sample gets provided for you to copy).

Additional instructions exist in the repositoryâ€™s README, plus the [Kinde documentation](https://kinde.com/docs).

For contributing guidelines, see the CONTRIBUTING.md doc.
